# Gear Guide: A Graph-Powered AI Chatbot for Smarter Troubleshooting 

## The Problem:
 Modern car owners often face technical issues, whether it's "AC not cooling" or "headlights flickering‚Äù but traditional troubleshooting tools and chatbots fall short. They struggle with maintaining context, handling ambiguous symptoms, and offering precise repair instructions. The experience is frustrating: repetitive conversations, generic answers, and no memory of what was said just moments ago. 

## The Spark:
 Our idea for **Gear Guide**, an AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot, was born out of this gap. We envisioned a smarter support assistant, one that *understands* vehicle systems, *remembers* user queries, and *guides* them through structured, contextual answers. By blending **OpenAI‚Äôs embeddings** with **Neo4j‚Äôs graph-based knowledge** and a **hybrid retrieval strategy**, we designed a chatbot that behaves less like a script and more like a *skilled mechanic‚Äôs assistant*. 

 

## How It Works: Under the Hood of Gear Guide

Gear Guide combines the best of semantic search and knowledge graphs: 

1. **A Rich, Structured Knowledge Base** 
     We modeled technical car data as a graph in Neo4j, organizing relationships between components, symptoms, procedures, and problems. For example: 

     a. "AC not cooling" connects to symptoms like "low airflow" and tests like "compressor pressure check". 

     b. "Remote key not working" links to "keyless entry malfunction", a common user concern. 

2. **Data Ingestion via LLM**
     Manuals and troubleshooting documents were converted into structured XML using a custom PDF-to-Graph pipeline powered by GPT. Tags like `<symptom>, <procedure>, and <test>` were extracted to feed into the Neo4j graph‚Äîno manual curation needed. 

3. **Hybrid Retrieval (Dense + Sparse)**

     a. **Dense Retrieval** uses OpenAI‚Äôs embeddings + Neo4j vector index for semantic matches. 

     b. **Sparse Retrieval** uses full-text Lucene search to capture exact keyword hits. 

     c. A **Hybrid Strategy** reranks results using a weighted score `(hybrid_score = Œ± * dense + (1-Œ±) * sparse)`, ensuring the best of both worlds: relevance and accuracy. 

4. **Multi-Turn Conversations**
     Every query goes through rephrasing and context injection, allowing the system to maintain continuity in chat sessions‚Äîan often-missing feature in traditional bots. 

5. **Interactive UI**
     The frontend is built with Flask, providing a responsive interface where users can ask natural questions like: 

     a. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt my AC working?‚Äù 

     b. ‚ÄúHow do I replace the bumper on a Yaris?‚Äù 

     c. ‚ÄúWhat could cause dim headlights after engine start?‚Äù 

 

## Why It Matters 

**Gear Guide isn‚Äôt just a chatbot‚Äîit‚Äôs a structured AI assistant that thinks in graphs.**

By linking symptoms, problems, and test procedures with real-world semantics, we provide users with a guided diagnostic experience. Our hybrid search approach outperforms both keyword-based and purely semantic systems, delivering answers that are contextually rich and technically grounded. 

 

## Key Impact 

- **Smarter Repairs**: Faster and more accurate troubleshooting for drivers and technicians 

- **Context-Aware AI**: True multi-turn memory and relevance optimization 

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines the power of semantic understanding and exact match precision 

- **Graph-Powered Insights**: Every problem is navigated through connected components and causes

## PDF ‚Üí Structured XML via LLM

### Script: `pdf_extraction.py`
- Extracts raw text from manuals
- Breaks long text into chunks
- Uses GPT to output structured data with tags like:
  ```xml
  <problem>ac not cooling</problem>
  <symptom>weak airflow</symptom>
  <test><name>compressor test</name><procedure>Check pressure</procedure></test>
- Tags are flexible; non-standard tags are stored under <additional_info>


## Data Ingestion Flow

### Script Logic

**Function:** `parse_and_insert_data(xml_content, component_name)`
- Cleans XML from LLM output
- Maps each XML tag to Neo4j label via [`tag_to_label_map`](data/constants.py)
- Creates and links graph nodes using Cypher queries
- Handles nested problems and long lists efficiently
- Uses APOC for conditional logic in Cypher (dynamic merging)

---

## Embedding-Based Dense Retrieval

### Function: `get_openai_embedding`
- **Embedding Model:** `text-embedding-3-small`
- Converts user queries into dense vectors

**Function:** `vector_search(query_vector, node_label, top_k=10, threshold=0.7)`  
- **Vector Index Name:** `vectorIndex_<NodeLabel>`  
- **Cypher Syntax:**
  ```cypher
  CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes($index_name, $top_k, $query_vector)
  ```

---

## Sparse Retrieval

**Function:** `sparse_search(user_query, node_label)`  
Uses full-text search index:

```cypher
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('search_<Label>', $query) YIELD node, score
RETURN node.name, score
```

---

## Hybrid Retriever

**Function:** `Use ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize vector and full-text search`  
Combines dense and sparse scores:

```python
hybrid_score = alpha * dense_score + (1 - alpha) * sparse_score
```

- Create `retrieve_data()` to unify both retrieval strategies
- Normalize scores before combining
- Filter by top-k if needed
- Merge and deduplicate results by node name

### Query: "Remote key not working"

| Retrieval Mode | Top Match                      | Type    | Score | Notes                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Sparse**     | "key" ‚Üí "lock" ‚Üí "battery"     | Problem | 0.65  | Keyword match, misses context      |
| **Dense**      | "keyless entry not responding" | Problem | 0.86  | Captures intent, loses exact token |
| **Hybrid**     | "keyless entry malfunction"    | Problem | 0.92  | Best of both, exact + semantic     |

> **Conclusion:** Hybrid retrieval improved both relevance and clarity. It correctly inferred "remote key" refers to "keyless entry".

## Future Vision
Gear Guide began as a proof-of-concept for smarter troubleshooting using RAG and graph-based reasoning, but its potential goes far beyond automotive diagnostics. 
<br>
Here's where we see it heading: 

1. **Multi-Domain Diagnostic Assistant**

     Extend beyond vehicles into other verticals where structured troubleshooting is critical: 

     a. **Consumer electronics** (e.g., phone won't charge ‚Üí battery port ‚Üí test cable ‚Üí reset) 

     b. **Medical equipment** diagnostics for technicians 

     c. **Smart home systems** (e.g., thermostat issues, smart lock malfunctions) 

2. **Continual Knowledge Ingestion**

     Automate ingestion of new manuals, guides, and repair logs in real-time using: 

     - Fine-tuned LLMs for multi-lingual manuals 

     - Auto-tagging pipelines with confidence thresholds 

     - Crowdsourced updates from technician feedback 

3. **Voice-Enabled Mobile Companion**

     Build a mobile app where users can: 

     - Speak their car issues out loud ("my engine's rattling at startup") 

     - Get step-by-step procedures 

     - Use AR overlays (e.g., guide you to open the hood, check the dipstick) 

4. **Closed-Loop Learning System**

     - Track which troubleshooting paths led to successful resolutions 

     - Reinforce the knowledge graph based on real-world usage 

     - Use reinforcement learning or fine-tuning to improve LLM grounding 

5. **B2B Integration with Repair Shops**

     Partner with: 

     - Automotive repair shops for technician-facing AI tools 

     - Manufacturers for embedding Gear Guide in **owner apps**, **onboard systems**, or **support portals**.
